# Bookmark Challenge

## Introduction

This is the week 4 weekly challenge of the Makers Academy software engineering bootcamp. It consolidates the web app skills learnt in the previous week with the added complexity of working with a database.

## Requirements

You're going to build a bookmark manager. A bookmark manager is a website to maintain a collection of bookmarks (URLs). You can use it to save a webpage you found useful. You can add tags to the webpages you saved to find them later. You can browse bookmarks other users have added. You can comment on the bookmarks.

## User Story 1
```
As a User,
So I can see the bookmarks,
I would like the system to display a list of bookmarks.
```
